# Version 1.1

- `readTCGA` has now new `method` for `rppa` (reverse phase protein array)  and `mRNA` (Merge transcriptome agilent) files
- `datasetsTCGA` documentation has been extended with new datasets for `rppa` and `mrna`
- `downloadTCGA` now gives a warning when more than one file matches `dataSet` parameter, and downloads the first matched dataset without `FFPE` in the name. If all matching datasets have `FFPE` in the name then the first of them is downloaded.
- `checkTCGA` now downloads also sizes with datasets names when one specifies `what` parameter to `DatSets`.
- Updated tests for `checkTCGA`
